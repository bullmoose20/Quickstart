Welcome to Kometa Quickstart! This Web UI tool will guide you through creating a Configuration File to use with Kometa.

Special Thanks to [meisnate12](https://github.com/meisnate12), [bullmoose20](https://github.com/bullmoose20), [chazlarson](https://github.com/chazlarson) and [Yozora](https://github.com/yozoraXCII) for the time spent developing this tool.

## Prerequisites

It's ideal that you go through the Kometa install walkthrough prior to running Quickstart, as that will get Kometa set up to accept the config file that Quickstart will produce.  Running Quickstart and *then* the walkthrough could end up running into problems that will not be addressed in the walkthroughs; at best nothing in the walkthrough will match expectations so you will be left to figure out any differences yourself.

This will also familiarize you with setting up a virtual environment for running this as a Python script.

## Installing Quickstart

There are essentially 5 ways to install and run Quickstart. The order presented here is likely the simplest to the most advanced way of installing Quickstart.

> [!CAUTION]
> **We strongly recommend running this yourself rather than relying on someone else to host Quickstart.**
>
> This ensures that connection attempts are made exclusively to services and machines accessible only to you. Additionally, all credentials are stored locally, safeguarding your sensitive information from being stored on someone else's machine.

## 1 - Installing on Windows

- Go to the releases page to grab a single `exe` that you can run.
- https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Quickstart/releases
- Pick the build (`master` or `develop`) you are interested in and then go to the Assets section and pick the right `exe`
- Store it in its own folder and dbl-click to run
- Manage Quickstart from the system tray icon
![image](static/images/system-tray-launcher.png)

## 2 - Installing on Mac

- Go to the releases page to grab a single `exe` that you can run.
- https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Quickstart/releases
- Pick the build (`master` or `develop`) you are interested in and then go to the Assets section and pick the right `exe`
- Store it in its own folder and dbl-click to run. You may need to allow for unsigned applications to run within the MacOS settings under Privacy
- Manage Quickstart from the system tray icon
![image](static/images/system-tray-launcher-mac.png)

## 3 - Installing on Ubuntu (Linux)

- Go to the releases page to grab a single `exe` that you can run.
- https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Quickstart/releases
- Pick the build (`master` or `develop`) you are interested in and then go to the Assets section and pick the right `exe`
- Store it in its own folder and modify permissions to allow it to run (chmod 755). Then dbl-click it to run.
- Manage Quickstart from the system tray icon
![image](static/images/system-tray-launcher-ubuntu.png)

> [!WARNING]
> You will likely need to perform these steps first to have a system tray icon show up:
```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-render-util0
```

## 4 - Running in Docker

NOTE: the `/config` directory in these examples is NOT the Kometa config directory.  Create a Quickstart-specific directory to map to `/config`.

Here are some minimal examples:

### `docker run`
```
docker run -it -v "/path/to/config:/config:rw" kometateam/quickstart:develop
```

### `docker compose`
```yaml
services:
  quickstart:
    image: kometateam/quickstart:develop
    container_name: quickstart
    ports:
      - 7171:7171
    environment:
      - TZ=TIMEZONE #optional
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config #edit this line for your setup
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## 5 - Installing on local:

These are high-level steps which assume the user has knowledge of python and pip, and the general ability to troubleshoot issues.

1. Clone or download and unzip the repo.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Kometa
```
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Quickstart
```

1. Move into the Quickstart directory.
```shell
cd Quickstart
```

1. Install dependencies (it is recommended to do this in a Python virtual environment `venv`):
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. If the above command fails, run the following command:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt --ignore-installed
```
## Detailed Steps if the high-level instructions are not clear enough

### Installation Steps for Windows :

At the end of this you will end up with side by side installs of Kometa and Quickstart:
```
c:\this\dir\has\Kometa
c:\this\dir\has\Quickstart
```
1. Ensure git and python are installed

Git Install: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Python Install: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/


1. git clone Kometa and switch to preferred branch (nightly, develop, master) (no need to do more at this point as Quickstart will perform the other steps automatically)

Open up a command prompt and run this (pick your directory and checkout nightly, develop, or master)

```shell
cd c:\this\dir\has
git clone https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Kometa
cd Kometa
git checkout nightly
git stash
git stash clear
git pull

```
3. git clone Quickstart, switch to develop branch, create venv, activate it, upgrade pip, install requirements

```shell
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Quickstart
cd Quickstart
git checkout develop
git stash
git stash clear
git pull
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

4. Run Quickstart and on final page, it will automatically create the kometa-venv, install requirements and then allow you to run kometa.py with your validated config created with Quickstart

```shell
python quickstart.py
```

### Installation Steps for Linux/Mac:

At the end of this you will end up with side by side installs of Kometa and Quickstart:
```
/this/dir/has/Kometa
/this/dir/has/Quickstart
```
1. Ensure git and python are installed

Git install: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Python Install:

Mac: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/

Ubuntu/Debian: ```sudo apt-get install python3```

Fedora: ```sudo dnf install python3```

2. git clone Kometa and switch to preferred branch (nightly, develop, master) (no need to do more at this point as Quickstart will perform the other steps automatically)

Open up a command prompt and run this (pick your directory and checkout nightly, develop, or master)

```shell
cd /this/dir/has
git clone https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Kometa
cd Kometa
git checkout nightly
git stash
git stash clear
git pull
```
3. git clone Quickstart, switch to develop branch, create venv, activate it, upgrade pip, install requirements

```shell
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Quickstart
cd Quickstart
git checkout develop
git stash
git stash clear
git pull
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4 Run quickstart and on final page, it will automatically create the kometa-venv, install requirements and then allow you to run kometa.py with your validated config created with Quickstart

```shell
python3 quickstart.py
```

At this point Quickstart has been installed and you should see something similar to this:

![image](static/images/running-in-pwsh.png)

Quickstart should launch a browser automatically. If you are on a headless machine (docker or linux without GUI) open a browser and navigate to the ip address of the machine Quickstart is running on and you should be taken to the Quickstart Welcome Page.

- Manage Quickstart from the system tray icon

### Debugging & Changing Ports

Users can choose to enable debugging mode which will add verbose logging to the console window.

There are three ways to enable debugging:
- Add `--debug` to your Run Command, for example: `python quickstart.py --debug`.
- Open the `.env` file at the root of the Quickstart directory, and set `QS_DEBUG=1` (restart required).
- Use the Quickstart system tray icon to toggle it on or off (no restart required).

Quickstart will run on port 7171 by default, this can be amended in one of three ways:
- Add `--port=XXXX` to your Run Command, for example: `python quickstart.py --port=1234`
- Open the `.env` file at the root of the Quickstart directory, and set `QS_PORT=XXXX` where XXXX is the port you want to run on. (restart required)
- Use the Quickstart system tray icon to choose a new port (restarts automatically).
